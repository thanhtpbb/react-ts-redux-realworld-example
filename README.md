# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### ReactJS + TypeScript + Vite codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **ReactJS** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **ReactJS** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

The general architecture of the app is based on a combination of React, TypeScript, and Vite, following the layout of the Realworld app. Let's break down each component of the architecture:

1. **React**: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and manage their state efficiently. React provides a declarative approach to building UIs, making it easier to develop complex applications.

2. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing capabilities to the language. It helps catch potential errors and provides better tooling support for development. By using TypeScript, the app gains improved code quality, better autocompletion, and easier refactoring.

3. **Vite**: Vite is a modern, fast, and lightweight build tool that is specifically designed for building frontend applications. It offers near-instantaneous hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds. Vite supports React and TypeScript out of the box, making it a suitable choice for this architecture.

4. **Realworld app layout**: The Realworld app layout is a project template that provides a common architecture for building real-world applications. It follows best practices and conventions for structuring the app's codebase. The layout typically includes folders for components, containers, services, utils, and more. It promotes separation of concerns and modular development.
